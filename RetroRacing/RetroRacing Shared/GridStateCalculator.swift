/// `GridStateCalculator` is responsible for computing the next state of a grid-based car game.
/// 
/// This class manages all logic related to updating the grid, moving the player's car, handling 
/// scoring, and detecting crashes. It operates on a `GridState` structure and provides effects 
/// that describe significant game events (such as scoring or crashing).
/// 
/// This class is stateless and does not hold any state.
/// The primary method, `nextGrid(previousGrid:actions:)`, is a pure function: it has no side effects and does not mutate its input.
/// 
/// - The primary method, `nextGrid(previousGrid:actions:)`, takes the previous state of the grid 
///   and a sequence of actions (such as updating the grid or moving the car), and returns a tuple 
///   with the updated grid and a list of effects.
/// - The class defines action types (such as updating and moving the car) and corresponding 
///   effects (like scoring points or crashing).
/// - Various private helper methods encapsulate logic for moving the car, inserting new rows, 
///   ensuring a minimum number of empty cells, and generating random row values.
/// 
/// Usage of this type is generally internal to the game engine and not intended for direct 
/// manipulation by UI components.
